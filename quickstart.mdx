# Quick Start Guide

<Info>
**Time to Safety:** Follow this guide to have Shelther protecting you in under 5 minutes. We'll walk you through everything from download to your first emergency contact setup.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Device Requirements" icon="mobile">
    **iOS 15.0+** or **Android 10+** (API level 29+)
    At least 500MB free storage space
  </Card>
  <Card title="Permissions Needed" icon="key">
    Location services, camera access, microphone, and notification permissions for full functionality
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Location Permissions:** Shelther requires location access to provide safety monitoring. We recommend selecting "Always Allow" for optimal protection, but "While Using App" will work for basic features.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Download & Install

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the App">
    **iOS:** Download from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/shelther)
    **Android:** Download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shelther.app)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install & Open">
    Install the app and open it. You'll see the welcome screen with setup options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant Initial Permissions">
    Allow notifications when prompted - these are critical for emergency alerts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Create Your Account

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Account Creation Options
// Multiple secure sign-up methods
const signUpMethods = [
  'email_password',      // Traditional email registration
  'google_oauth',        // Sign in with Google
  'apple_id',           // Sign in with Apple (iOS)
  'phone_verification'   // SMS-based verification
];

// All methods include:
const securityFeatures = {
  twoFactorAuth: 'optional_but_recommended',
  biometricLogin: 'fingerprint_face_id',
  emergencyBypass: 'access_without_biometrics'
};
```
</CodeGroup>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Sign-Up Method">
    Select your preferred registration method. We recommend Sign in with Apple or Google for fastest setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Your Identity">
    Complete email or phone verification to secure your account.

</Steps>

<Note>
**Privacy Note:** Your email is only used for account recovery and critical security notifications. We never send marketing emails or share your information.
</Note>

## Step 3: Essential Permissions Setup

<Info>
**Why These Permissions Matter:** Each permission enables specific safety features. We'll explain exactly what each one does and why it's important.
</Info>

### Location Services (Required)

<Accordion title="Location Permission Setup">
**iOS Setup:**
1. When prompted, tap "Allow While Using App" initially
2. Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Shelther

</Accordion>

### Camera & Microphone (Recommended)

<Accordion title="Media Permissions">
**What This Enables:**

**Privacy Protection:**
- Recording only happens during active emergencies or with explicit consent
- All audio/video is encrypted and stored locally until you choose to share
- You can revoke these permissions anytime while keeping core safety features
</Accordion>

### Notifications (Critical)

<Accordion title="Notification Setup">
**iPhone:**

</Accordion>

## Step 4: Create Your Circle of Trust

<Warning>
**Most Important Step:** Your Circle of Trust are the people who will be contacted in emergencies. Choose people who are reliable, typically available, and know how to respond to safety situations.
</Warning>

### Add Your Primary Contact

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Primary Contact">
    This should be your most trusted person - typically a family member or very close friend who is usually reachable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Contact Information">
    Add their name, phone number, and email address. Double-check for accuracy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Their Role">
    Primary contacts get immediate alerts and have access to your real-time location during emergencies.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Verification Invitation">
    Shelther will send them a text and email explaining the system and asking them to verify the connection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Contact Verification Process
// How contact verification works
const verificationProcess = {
  step1: {
    action: 'send_invitation',
    methods: ['sms', 'email'],
    expires: '48_hours',
    includes: ['explanation', 'app_download_link', 'verification_code']
  },
  
  step2: {
    action: 'contact_response',
    options: ['accept_and_install_app', 'accept_sms_only', 'decline'],
    creates: 'verified_connection'
  },
  
  step3: {
    action: 'test_notification',
    purpose: 'ensure_system_works',
    frequency: 'optional_monthly_test'
  }
};
```

```typescript Contact Permissions
// What contacts can see and do
const contactPermissions = {
  primary_contact: {
    emergency_alerts: 'immediate',
    location_access: 'real_time_during_emergencies',
    check_in_status: 'always',
    emergency_override: 'can_trigger_help_on_your_behalf'
  },
  
  secondary_contacts: {
    emergency_alerts: 'if_primary_no_response_5min',
    location_access: 'emergency_only',
    check_in_status: 'when_shared',
    emergency_override: 'limited'
  }
};
```
</CodeGroup>

### Add Secondary Contacts (Optional but Recommended)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Secondary Contact 1" icon="user">
    Another family member or close friend as backup to your primary contact
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secondary Contact 2" icon="users">
    A third person for redundancy - perhaps someone in a different time zone or with different availability
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Contact Advice:** Choose contacts who:
- Are typically responsive to their phone
- Know your routine and would recognize unusual behavior
- Live in a location where they can help or coordinate help
- Understand the importance of emergency response
</Note>

## Step 5: Configure Your Safety Settings

### Basic Safety Preferences

<Accordion title="Emergency Trigger Settings">
**Physical Triggers:**
- Volume + Power button hold time (default: 3 seconds)

</Accordion>

### Privacy & Data Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Location Sharing Preferences">
    Choose default location sharing duration and accuracy levels for different contact types
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Retention">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Emergency Data">
    Configure what information is shared during emergencies (location, audio, photos)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Test Your Setup

<Info>
**Critical Step:** Testing ensures everything works when you need it most. This is not optional - your safety depends on a working system.
</Info>

### Test Emergency Alerts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Inform Your Contacts">
    Let your Circle of Trust know you're testing the system so they don't panic
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger Test Alert">
    Use the "Test Emergency System" button in Settings > Emergency > Test System
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Notifications">
    Confirm all contacts receive test notifications and can see your location
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Response">
    Have contacts test their response process - knowing how to acknowledge alerts and coordinate help
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Testing Best Practices:**
- Always warn contacts before testing
- Use only the designated test function, never real emergency triggers
- Test at least once per month to ensure continued functionality
- Update contacts immediately if someone doesn't receive test notifications
</Warning>

### Test Physical Triggers

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Testing Checklist
// Physical trigger testing
const testPhysicalTriggers = [
  {
    trigger: 'volume_power_hold',
