  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Real-Time Data Flow

<Accordion title="Emergency Alert Flow">
**Trigger Phase (0-3 seconds):**
1. User activates emergency trigger
2. App captures current location with high accuracy
3. Local storage backup created immediately
4. UI provides immediate feedback and countdown

**Processing Phase (3-10 seconds):**
1. Alert record created in Supabase database
2. Real-time notification sent to subscribed contacts
3. SMS/email fallback notifications triggered
4. Evidence collection begins (audio/photo if configured)

**Escalation Phase (10+ seconds):**
1. Contact acknowledgment tracking
2. Auto-escalation if no response within timeframe
3. Emergency services notification (where available)
4. Continuous location updates until resolved
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Location Sharing Flow">
**Activation:**
1. User initiates location sharing with specific contacts
2. Permission-based access control applied
3. Real-time subscription established
4. Battery optimization algorithm activated

**Real-time Updates:**
1. Location captured at optimized intervals
2. Data encrypted before transmission
3. Real-time updates pushed to authorized contacts
4. Offline queueing if connectivity lost

**Privacy Controls:**
1. Automatic expiration based on user settings
2. Granular permission management
3. Location precision controls (exact vs approximate)
4. Instant revocation capabilities
</Accordion>

## Data Architecture

### Database Design Philosophy

<Note>
**Privacy-First Database Design:** All tables implement Row Level Security (RLS) ensuring users can only access their own data, with carefully designed sharing mechanisms for emergency contacts.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```sql Core Safety Tables
-- User management with privacy controls
users (id, email, phone_number, full_name, created_at)
user_profiles (user_id, emergency_contacts, safety_preferences)

-- Location and emergency data
location_updates (id, user_id, location, accuracy, is_emergency)
emergency_alerts (id, user_id, alert_type, status, location, evidence)
check_ins (id, user_id, scheduled_time, status, location)

-- Sharing and permissions
location_shares (id, user_id, shared_with_user_id, permissions, expires_at)
contact_verifications (id, user_id, contact_id, verification_status)

-- Community safety data
venues (id, name, location, safety_rating, verified)
venue_reports (id, venue_id, user_id, report_type, description)
```

```sql Real-time Subscriptions
-- Tables enabled for real-time updates
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE location_updates;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE emergency_alerts;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE check_ins;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE location_shares;

-- Subscription filters for privacy
ROW LEVEL SECURITY policies ensure:
- Users only receive updates for their own data
- Emergency contacts receive updates during active sharing
- No unauthorized access to sensitive location data
```
</CodeGroup>

### Offline-First Data Strategy

      return location; // Full precision for emergency use
    case 'approximate':
      return {
        ...location,
        latitude: Math.round(location.latitude * 100) / 100,   // ~1km accuracy
        longitude: Math.round(location.longitude * 100) / 100,
      };
    case 'city_only':
      return {
        ...location,
