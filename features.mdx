  distanceInterval: 50, // 50 meters
  backgroundPermissions: true,
  batteryOptimization: true
};

// Privacy-first location sharing
const shareLocation = async (contactId: string, duration: number) => {
  const encryptedLocation = await encryptLocationData(currentLocation);
  return supabase.from('location_shares').insert({
    contact_id: contactId,
    encrypted_location: encryptedLocation,
    expires_at: new Date(Date.now() + duration * 1000)
  });
};

      data: { checkInId: checkIn.id }
    },
    trigger: { date: new Date(reminderTime) }
  });
};
```

```typescript Escalation Protocol
// Missed check-in handling
const handleMissedCheckIn = async (checkIn: CheckIn) => {
  // Grace period - send gentle reminder
  setTimeout(() => {
    sendPushNotification("Running late? Tap to extend your check-in time");
  }, 2 * 60 * 1000); // 2 minutes
  
  // Primary alert - notify Circle of Trust
  setTimeout(() => {
    notifyPrimaryContacts(checkIn);
    startLocationSharing();
  }, 5 * 60 * 1000); // 5 minutes
  
  // Secondary alert - escalate to broader network
  setTimeout(() => {
