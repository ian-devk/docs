## Key AI Capabilities

### Behavioral Pattern Recognition

The AI system continuously learns your normal patterns to identify potential anomalies:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Routine Learning">
    Analyzes your typical locations, timing, and movement patterns to establish baseline behavior
  </Step>
  <Step title="Anomaly Detection">
    Identifies deviations from normal patterns that might indicate safety concerns or emergencies
  </Step>
  <Step title="Context Awareness">
    Considers factors like day of week, time, weather, and events when evaluating patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adaptive Learning">
    Continuously updates models as your routines change while maintaining privacy
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Risk Assessment Engine

<Accordion title="Real-time Risk Scoring">
**Location Risk Factors:**
- Historical incident reports from community
- Time-of-day risk variations
- Crowd density and activity levels
- Proximity to emergency services
- Lighting and visibility conditions

**Personal Risk Factors:**
- Your historical comfort levels with venues
- Previous safety incidents or concerns
- Social context (alone vs. with others)
- Transportation method and timing
- Battery level and connectivity status

**Dynamic Risk Calculation:**
```typescript
interface RiskAssessment {
  overall_score: number;        // 0-100 risk level
  confidence: number;           // Model confidence in assessment
  contributing_factors: {
    location_history: number;   // Historical safety data
    time_context: number;       // Time-based risk factors  
    social_context: number;     // Alone vs. group factors
    environmental: number;      // Weather, lighting, etc.
    personal_history: number;   // Your past experiences
  };
  recommendations: string[];    // Actionable safety suggestions
  alert_thresholds: {
    yellow: number;            // Caution level
    orange: number;            // Elevated concern
    red: number;               // High risk
  };
}
```
</Accordion>

### Predictive Safety Alerts

<Warning>
**Proactive Protection:** AI Insights can predict potential safety concerns 15-30 minutes before they might occur, giving you time to take preventive action.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Route Safety Analysis" icon="route">
    Analyzes planned routes for safety concerns and suggests alternatives
  </Card>
  <Card title="Venue Risk Prediction" icon="building">
    Warns about venues with elevated risk based on time, events, or recent reports
  </Card>
  <Card title="Social Context Alerts" icon="users">
    Identifies when you're in potentially vulnerable situations (alone, late hours)
