## The Problem We Solve

In moments of uncertainty, technology should empower, not complicate. Yet the safety solutions landscape remains surprisingly flawed:

<Warning>
**Current Safety App Problems:**
- **Anxiety Engines:** Most safety apps inadvertently create a perpetual state of alarm
- **Paralysis by Complexity:** Critical features buried behind multiple taps become unusable during stress
- **Battery Drain:** Power-hungry monitoring leaves you vulnerable when protection matters most
- **Privacy Trade-offs:** Excessive data collection creates uncomfortable choices between security and privacy
</Warning>

Shelther breaks this pattern with intelligent design that anticipates real-world scenarios. Our technology stays vigilant in the background, activates instantly when needed, and provides meaningful protection without compromising your digital autonomy.

## How Shelther Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Your Safety Network">
    Create your "Circle of 3" - trusted contacts who will be notified in emergencies. Set up your safety preferences and emergency protocols.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate Protection">
    Use the app widget or main app to activate monitoring when going out. Choose from different safety modes based on your activity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated Monitoring">
    Shelther intelligently monitors your location, movement patterns, and scheduled check-ins using advanced AI and sensor data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Instant Response">
    If something goes wrong, trigger help instantly or let our automated systems detect anomalies and alert your network.
  </Step>
</Steps>
