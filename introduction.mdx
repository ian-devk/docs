## The Problem We Solve

Personal safety technology has evolved, but most solutions still fall short of real-world reliability requirements:

<Warning>
**Current Safety App Limitations:**
- **Reliability Issues:** Apps that fail during critical moments due to poor architecture
- **Battery Drain:** Power-hungry solutions that leave you vulnerable when protection matters
- **Complex Interfaces:** Multi-step processes that become unusable under stress
- **Privacy Concerns:** Excessive data collection without transparent user control
- **False Positives:** Over-sensitive alerts that train users to ignore notifications
</Warning>

Shelther addresses these fundamental issues with enterprise-grade architecture, intelligent design patterns, and production-tested reliability. Our platform anticipates real-world scenarios and maintains vigilant protection without compromising usability or privacy.

## How Shelther Works
